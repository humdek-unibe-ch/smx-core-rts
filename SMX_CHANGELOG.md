### Bug Fixes

 - Fix macro signature for setting a channel read timeout in test modus.


-------------------
# `v0.10.0`

### New Features

 - Add logging to mapping functions.
 - Allow to set a source map prefix to distinguish between different source
   payloads.
 - Allow to disable a net through the configuration option `is_disabled`.

### Changes

 - A new major version is required due to potential alignment problems in
   structures.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix memory leaks when RTS initialisation fails.


-------------------
# `v0.9.3` (deprecated)

### New Features

 - Allow to disable a net through the configuration option `is_disabled`.


-------------------
# `v0.9.2`

### New Features

 - Allow to set the backup buffer of a channel through an input port.


-------------------
# `v0.9.1`

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix log dependency


-------------------
# `v0.9.0`

### Changes

 - Versioning dvl package
 - Make static config pre-requisite for pre-initialisation

### New Features

 - Allow to pass a read-only JSON structure to the RTS.
 - Extends data mappings with a key to later identify a mapping.


-------------------
# `v0.8.4`

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix channel timeout handling (nsec values were simply added without taking
   spilling to seconds into account)
 - Fix memory leak in config maps.


-------------------
# `v0.8.3`

### Changes

 - Only log FIFO tail overwrite to `notice` if the FIFO length `>1`,
   use `info` otherwise.


-------------------
# `v0.8.2`

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix a problem with data mappings when payloads or source paths are not
   defined.


-------------------
# `v0.8.1`

### New Features

 - Improve config data maps to increase usability


-------------------
# `v0.8.0`

### Changes

 - `smx_program_init()` now expects additional parameters `app_conf_maps` and
   `app_conf_map_count`.
 - install include files to versioned folder.
 - remove debian stuff to handle this in a seperate wrapper.

### New Features

 - Add init config getter functions for a more convenient way to detect missing
   values.
 - Add strerror function for config errors.
 - Add strerror function for channel errors.
 - Allow config maps to overwrite config settings. This is useful to create
   several configuration flavors without changing the default config.

### Bug Fixes

-------------------
# `v0.7.2`

### New Features

 - Add getter defines for net attributes (loop count, thread prio).

   whenever any input channel terminates.


-------------------
# `v0.7.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix concurrency issue with collector mutex: move collector operations inside
   channel mutex locks. This will avoid unnecessary executions of `smx_rn` nets.

### Changes

 - Add more lttng probes to allow for tracing blocking operations.
 - Disable mutex locks on log by default (dangerous in when using TT nets).

### New Features

 - Add net config option `expected_rate` which allows to log warning if the
   net rate is lower or higher than expected.
 - Allow to allocate a state which can be shared between nets.


-------------------
# `v0.6.2`

### Changes

 - Log a write warning if a fifo buffer was filled (and length is bigger than
   1).


-------------------
# `v0.6.1`

### Changes

 - Pass net pointer to the content filter.
 - Only log failed write channel access to terminated consumer once.


-------------------
# `v0.6.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix the counting mechanism in the test functions to allow for multiple reads
   or writes in one net execution iteration.
 - Provide a test data reader which is memory save. The old one is kept for
   legacy reasons.

### Changes

 - Accumulate overwrite fifo messages to avoid log bursts.
 - Change type of message ID from `unsigned long` to `unsigned long long`.
 - In order to catch all test read and write operations the test file in the box
   implementation must now overwrite the RTS versions. The redefinitions in the
   RTS have been removed.


-------------------
# `v0.5.6`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix open port connection problem when open port is omitted in Streamix
 - fix zlog initialisation check

### Changes

 - reduce log level for rate-controller messages from notice to info
 - add base message type definitions

-------------------
# `v0.5.3`

### Changes

 - allocate/free channel name


-------------------
# `v0.5.2`

### Changes

 - allocate/free net and impl name


-------------------
# `v0.5.1`

### Bug Fixes

 - protect content filter setter with mutex


-------------------

 - add support for channel read and write timeouts
 - allow to dynamically configure each net


-------------------

 - use specific zlog version
 - add debian revision to config

 - first check message type filter, then check message content filter.


-------------------
# `v0.3.1`

### Changes

 - Log version numbers on level NOTICE.
 - Log RTS version number.


-------------------
# `v0.3.0`

   JSON configuration file
 - Allow to address each net instance in configuration (#14)

 - Add profiling capabilities with [lttng](https://lttng.org/) (#13)
 - Allow to check for the reason if a channel read or write operation fails (#8)

 - Add a type field to the message structure.
 - Add a macro to access the implementation name.
 - Add a utility function to filter message types.
 - Add generic message type and message content filter functionality that acts
   upon writing a message to a channel. For reasons of performance, the type
   filter can be disabled globally with a boolean config option `type_filter`.


-------------------
# `v0.1.0`

### Bug Fixes

 - fix the TF read function (#1)
 - fix the termination behaviour of TF
 - fix the termination behaviour of RN

### Changes

 - Cleanup cond vars (move the cond var from fifo to channel level)
 - Use a common net structure to store information every net has
 - Create channel ends to better distinguish between read and write operations
 - Add new FIFO types to handle special case of TFs (see #1)

 - Each custom net must now define an init and cleanup function
 - Propagate termination signals in both directions
 - Use zlog categories to distinguish between different concept
 - Include multiple log levels
 - Make the routing node fair when reading from inputs (a rn has now state)
 - Allow to configure whether a TF copies msgs on DL miss of the producer or
   sends a NULL msg (if copy is enabled every msg has to be backed up)
 - Run TF and TF-framed nets as RT-Tasks with different priorities
 - Add profiling capabilities (requires a box to capture the profiling events,
   e.g. `smx_mogo`)
 - At the end of an app execution log execution time and box execution counts
